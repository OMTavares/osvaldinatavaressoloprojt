    Located in the equatorial zone of the Atlantic Ocean, on the African continent, 
    500 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, Cape Verde is an archipelago made up of ten islands of volcanic origin. 
    The country was a Portuguese colony and, after four centuries of intense exploration, 
    the original vegetation practically became extinct and its independence was only obtained in 1975.
    Santiago is the largest island in Cape Verde, with approximately 50% of the population.

    Cape Verde's culture has a strong European and African influence. The local musical rhythms, such as morna, funan√° and batuque, are much admired by the population.
         There are still many local festivities, such as religious festivals and drumming practices.
        The Carnival of Mindelo is considered the main cultural manifestation of Cape Verde.
         In gastronomy, the consumption of fish and shellfish, in addition to corn and rice, stands out. 
         Cachupa is a typical dish of the country. 
        In terms of sports, football, basketball and handball stand out.
